# Codenames: Duet Board Generator
You can use [this App](https://bkarw12.github.io/) to play Codenames: Duet using the basic version of the game.\
The App assumes you are sitting in front of each other (if not, Player 2's board is flipped).\
The board is generated based on the seed text entered below. You can get a random seed by hitting the 'Randomize' button.\
Both players should open this app on their devices. Use Player 1/2 buttons to set which player are you.
